# Loops

Kvexium provides several types of loops to manage repetitive tasks and iterations through data structures. The following are the available loop structures:

### For-Loop
  The for loop in Kvexium is used to iterate over a specific range or sequence.

  ```kvexium
  for (variable: type := start_value; condition, increment) {
    // Loop body
  }
  ```

  Example:
  ```kvexium
  for (i: i8 := 0; i <= 8, i++) {
    emitln("i (&{i}) is smaller or equal to 8\n")
  }
  ```

In this example, `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` on each iteration, until it reaches `8`. If the condition `i <= 8` is satisfied, the loop body is executed.
